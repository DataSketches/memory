# DataSketches Memory
 The goal of this package is to provide high performance access to native memory for primitives
 and primitive arrays. It also provides consistent views into heap-based arrays,
 Java ByteBuffers and memory mapped files. This package is general purpose, has minimal external
 runtime dependencies and can be used in any application that needs to manage data structures outside
 the Java heap.
