===========The Dist Deployment Structure==========="
The DataSketche base directories in https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/ are:"
 - dev/incubator/datasketches/"
 - release/incubator/datasketches/"

 Each of these two directories contain a KEYS file, which is where you must have your GPG public key stored."

After graduation the base directories will be the same but without the incubator level."

For both the dev and the release branches, the root contains sub-directories for each of "
the datasketches-X repositories as follows:"
 - characterization/"
 - core/"
 - cpp/"
 - hive/"
 - memory/"
 - pig/"
 - postgresql/"
 - vector/"

Below these sub=directories is a level of leaf directories that define a particular release or release candidate."

Finally the leaf directories contain the zip and signature files for a release or release candidate."
The full tree will look something like this example:"
  dist/"
    dev/"
      incubator/"
        datasketches/"
          KEYS"
          memory/"
            0.12.3-incubating-RC1/"
              apache-datasketches-memory-0.12.3-incubating-src.zip"
              apache-datasketches-memory-0.12.3-incubating-src.zip.asc"
              apache-datasketches-memory-0.12.3-incubating-src.zip.sha512"
          etc."
